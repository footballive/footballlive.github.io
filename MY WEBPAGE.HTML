                              <p>The Serie A 21/22 season has been great has the Italian teams have been turning it up. Tough matches have been played and amazing goals have been scored if you agree with me.</p>

                                <p>Now one of the team that are really turning things up is the great Football Club Internazionale Milano otherwise known as Inter Milan, they have made a good impression this season with Simone Inzaghi (Manager) leading from victory to victory. Yes! I know they lost to AC Milan on the 5TH of February, but that was their second loss in 23 matches played </p>

                                <p>Lautaro Martinez is Inter Milan's star man as he is the top scorer for the team with 11 Goals, 2 Assists and 21 Appearances. Edin Dzeko is also another top player for Inter Milan as he the second top score for the team with 9 Goals, 4 Assists and 22 Appearances</p>

                                 <p>Napoli is also another team that is giving it their all as they are second on the table. They won against Venezia (2-0) which gave them the second spot on the table, right now the Belgian Dries Merten is their top goalscorer with 7 Goals to his name.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>Right now the highest goalscorers in Serie A are Ciro Immobile and Dusan Vlahovic both with 18 Goals. Now I know what you must be thinking but they are not Machines but football is for those who come into the staduim with goals and eventually they convert those goals to Goals. </p>

                                     <p>I can't lie though Real Madrid also known as the Los Blancos have really been on top form as they are topping the table, not only are they the leaders of the La Liga right now but they have players in all the stats the season as to provide. But the player really tearing it up is Karim Benzema.
                                        
                                     </p>

                                     <p>Karim Benzema is one of the best player in Real Madrid  and La Liga right now as he is incredibly the highest goalscorer for his team and La Liga this season with the total of 17 Goals and 7 Assists, now those are great stats for a striker won,t you agree with me?  </p>

                                     <p>A team that isn't meeting standards I have to say is Barcelona as they have not really been in best form this season with the sacking of former coach Ronald Koeman who really didn't make a change to the club's woeful stats to the signing of Xavi Hernandes(Former Barcelona Player from 1998-2015) who has promised to take the club to great heights. Right now sitting in fourth place Barcelona have played 22 Matches, won 10, lost 4 and with a total point of 38.</p>  
                                     <p>Barcelona's top goalscorer this season is Memphis Depay with a total of 8 Goals and 2 Assists. Hopefully the new coach Xavi will indeed be able to take the team to a new era. </p>
